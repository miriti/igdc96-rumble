RUMBLE
=============

Entry for contest #96 at [Independed Games Developers Contests](http://igdc.ru/).
Theme was cloning "Missile Command". I was not really excited about the theme so I decided to practice in Java and LWJGL. I made 2D "enginge" over LWGL with gamepad support. So this entry not really a game, but good demonstration of work with LWJGL and JInput.
